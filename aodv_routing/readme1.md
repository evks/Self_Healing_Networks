AODV (Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector) is a reactive routing protocol for mobile networks that establishes paths only when needed, minimizing background overhead by avoiding the maintenance of a constant network map. When a source node requires a route, it broadcasts a Route Request (RREQ) packet that floods the network, allowing intermediate nodes to log a "reverse path" back to the sender. Once the RREQ reaches the destination or a node with a fresh route, a Route Reply (RREP) is sent back along that established trail to finalize the connection. To manage node mobility, AODV utilizes periodic HELLO messages to monitor neighbor connectivity and uses Destination Sequence Numbers to ensure that all routes are fresh and loop-free, triggering a Route Error (RERR) message to notify the source if an active link breaks.
